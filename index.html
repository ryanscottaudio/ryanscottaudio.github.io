            My recent <a href="#work-experience">work experience</a> includes stints at Mural, where I organized, oversaw, and contributed lots of code to my team's effort to totally rebuild our purchase flow from the ground up, and Braze, where I built a widely-used feature to allow marketers to reuse blocks of content across messages and channels, among many other projects. By the way, check out my <a href="#side-projects">side projects</a> if you have a chance, I've been working on some fun stuff.

            <strong>Problem:</strong> the classes my girlfriend and I want to take at our gym have very few slots and fill up extremely quickly. Worse, different classes become available at different times. How are we ever going to get swole?

            Back in the 2020 quarantine, I wanted to create a way for my friends and family to connect that felt familiar and fun. To that end, I decided to build a web version of the popular game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrity_(game)">Fishbowl</a> that we could all play while in Zoom sessions together.
